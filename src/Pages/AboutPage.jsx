          I'm Jeethan Shan Tauro, a 2nd-year B.Tech CSE student at UVCE (University of Visvesvaraya College of Engineering). I have a strong passion for programming and problem-solving, which has helped me score an 8.9 CGPA in my first year. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Iâ€™m also an active member of two clubsâ€”GDG (Google Developers Group), where Iâ€™m part of the designing team, and MARVEL, where Iâ€™m exploring the CL-CY domain (Cloud Computing and Cybersecurity) as a batch student.
          <br />
          <br />
          When Iâ€™m not busy with academics or club activities, I enjoy learning new skills and tackling creative challenges. Thatâ€™s a little bit about me! If youâ€™re curious to know more, feel free to check out my resume below. ðŸ˜Š
